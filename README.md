# Keras-poly-curve-fitting

This notebook was created to perform curve fitting using **Neural Networks** on some generated polynomial data using the **Keras** library. The generated data, curve fit and, training and validation errors at each epoch have been plotted for better visualization of the Neural Network's performance.

The notebook also has some markdown describing very common terminology that one encounters' while handling Neural Networks, however much focus has been given to the code. Feel free to add more markdown in your version.

>_'Neurons that fire together wire together'_ - Donald Hebb

This notebook has been created for assignments, and beginners who would like to dabble into **Deep Learning** using the Keras library, however some knowledge of basic terminology and sound knowledge of Python is highly suggested.
